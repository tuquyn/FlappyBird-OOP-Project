**Introduction:**  
* *We love to make a loop game that means we can minimize the number of different levels as the bugs in each level like Boom Game, PacMan.
As we know, Flappy Bird is a popular game title so we can find many references and assets. We want to build the new one that is interesting with the same rules game.*  

**Technologies**
> Java 17

**Launch**  
- Game entrance is `FlappyBird-OOP-Project\src\FlappyBird\Main.java` run `main method` directly.
